This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

            "    *   **2008年強烈颱風鳳凰 (Fung-wong)：** 這個鳳凰颱風則是直接登陸台灣的「穿心颱」，從花蓮登陸，由西部出海，對全台灣都造成了強風豪雨的影響，是當年一個災情相當嚴重的颱風。\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **誤聽或誤傳的資訊：** 有時候天氣預報會提到未來可能生成的熱帶系統，但命名是在其強度達到「輕度颱風」等級後才會進行。您聽到的可能是關於某個熱帶性低氣壓的討論，但它尚未被命名。\n",

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nMovie Review: Interstellar (Long-form Sample Review) Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” stands as one\\nof the most ambitious cinematic attempts to merge hard science, emotional storytelling, and\\nphilosophical inquiry into a unified experience. Set in a near-future world plagued by ecological\\ncollapse, the film follows Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, who is recruited to travel through\\na wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. What makes “Interstellar” particularly compelling is\\nnot merely its spectacle, but its deep exploration of human resilience, sacrifice, and the enduring\\nconnection between parents and children. One of the strongest aspects of “Interstellar” lies in its\\nthematic depth. Nolan frames humanity’s survival not as a triumph of technology alone, but as a\\ntestament to cooperation, trust, and emotional courage. The relationship between Cooper and his\\ndaughter Murph drives the emotional center of the film. Their bond not only shapes the narrative but\\nbecomes the key to unlocking the film’s scientific and metaphysical mysteries. This blending of intimate\\nemotion with cosmic scale is rare in science fiction, and Nolan executes it with precision. Visually,\\n“Interstellar” is nothing short of breathtaking. The depiction of the wormhole, the spinning endurance\\nspacecraft, and the haunting beauty of the distant planets showcases Nolan’s commitment to scientific\\nauthenticity. With the help of physicist Kip Thorne, the film presents astrophysical phenomena—black\\nholes, time dilation, gravitational anomalies—in ways both accurate and visually stunning. Few films\\nmanage to balance scientific integrity with visual grandeur at this level. The film’s score, composed by\\nHans Zimmer, elevates the narrative to another dimension. Instead of relying on conventional\\norchestral bombast, Zimmer employs a minimalist, organ-driven approach that evokes both the\\nvastness of space and the vulnerability of the human soul. The music becomes a character in its own\\nright, highlighting tension, sorrow, discovery, and transcendence. Despite its acclaim, “Interstellar” is\\nnot without criticisms. Some viewers argue that the film’s final act, which leans heavily into\\nmetaphysical territory, departs from the grounded scientific foundation established earlier. However,\\nothers see this as a natural evolution of the film’s themes, suggesting that love and human connection\\nare forces as real—and as powerful—as gravity. Whether one interprets the ending literally or\\nmetaphorically, it undeniably sparks discussion and reflection. Overall, “Interstellar” remains a modern\\nmasterpiece. It is a film that challenges its viewers intellectually while also resonating emotionally. Its\\nlayered story rewards multiple viewings, and its visual and auditory craftsmanship is timeless. More\\nthan a decade after its release, “Interstellar” continues to inspire conversation about humanity’s future,\\nour place in the universe, and the bonds that define who we are. For anyone seeking a film that\\ncombines spectacle, science, and soul, “Interstellar” stands as one of the finest achievements in\\ncontemporary cinema.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

        "zero-shot的分類效果最弱，準確率僅約五成，模型在沒有示例的情況下只能依靠語言直覺推測，四類情緒的分類表現不均衡，且在混淆矩陣中可以看到明顯的跨類別誤判。當加入一個示例後，模型的分類能力大幅提升，1-shot的準確率提高到六成以上，四個情緒類別在precision與recall上都有明顯改善，混淆矩陣也顯示模型的分類邏輯更集中、誤分類明顯減少，整體效果最為穩定。然而，當示例增加到五個時，模型的表現並未進一步提升，準確率反而略為下降，部分類別甚至出現分類不穩定的情況，推測可能是prompt過長或示例資訊過多造成干擾，使模型無法有效吸收額外訊息。因此，本次實驗顯示少量示例（1-shot）即可帶來最佳效益，而示例數量並非越多越好。"

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
